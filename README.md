# Next.js + Jest starter app with a few example WIP components for My Herbarium prototype

A quick draft of what a starting point might look like for the My Herbarium prototype.

- Includes examples for how routing (index page), `Home`, `Card` and `SliderWithIcon` components might combine to form the structure of the application.
- Illustrates a typical component folder structure including component, styles, types and tests.
- Demonstrates how range inputs could be used for a simple and accessible slider UI.
- Also includes an example of how colour design tokens could be used.
- Further components, helpers and tests should be added to build out the remaining functionality for the prototype.
- Jest and React Testing Library are included as a typical testing framework.
